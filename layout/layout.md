### Wrap Golden Layout

wrapper provides:
	- fixed action bar based on configuration (and possibly other fixed elements)
	- allows tree to have "snap closed, snap open" behavior
	- utils for moving fixed elements to edges of screen
	- handles loading and remembering a wrapped config which allows the above
	- handle yaml config versus json
	- utils for programmatically spliting current pane
	- utils for tracking "current pane"
	- build script for layout
	- identify where a frame is, let frame know this
	- allow tab active/inactive/changed color to be set

### General New Layout

TODO:
	- terminal needs to load to the service it is passed in params
	- editor needs to trigger drag the same way that index.drag.html does it (mostly)
	- main page needs to load service worker the way it currently does (or better)
	- main page needs to handle events like it currently does
	- main page needs to handle right context menus (and maybe more)
