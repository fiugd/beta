# bartok v0.4.3

  - [ ] handle rename, delete, move files for commit
  - [ ] on repo "clone", don't pull all files (instead wait for pull or pull as needed)
  - [ ] terminal has its own cwd not dependent on app cwd
  - [ ] terminal should get cwd and service name from query params
  - [ ] terminal watch mode for js files (+more maybe)
  - [ ] preview as a terminal command vs a menu item
  - [ ] editor detect tabs vs spaces per file
  - [ ] terminal left/right arrows for editing buffer

  - [ ] cd into parent/child results in going parent/parent/child
  - [ ] cd to / (root) then git commit/diff mess up
  - [ ] switch services and come back, tabs don't trigger editor properly
    - this specifically occurs with bartokv0.4.3.md
    - also occurs in other situations

  - [ ] editor tabs order of next tab closing should make sense
  - [ ] explorer: add expand|collapse

  - [X] editor tabs close others, close all
  - [X] explorer: fix new folder|file icons
  - [X] when file is selected for preview, use full path of file
  - [X] on commit, update file and changes stores
  - [X] git commit should offer message on success/fail
  - [X] something is messed up about cwd from app (esp for files at root)
