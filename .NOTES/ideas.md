_a running list of all the explorations I would like to dig deeper into_

### Simulations
- N-copter
	- quad copter
	- copter with any given number of rotors
	- real physics for rotors
- biped - n-ped
	- biped locomotion
	- n-legged locomotion
- wheeled vehicles kenematics
	- [pros-and-cons-for-different-types-of-drive-selection](https://robohub.org/pros-and-cons-for-different-types-of-drive-selection/)
	- differential drive robot
	- ackerman steering (car)
	- holonomic robot
	- ball robot
	- treaded


### Machine Learning
- when should bank account be checked? (predict likliehood of change)


### Reinforcement Learning
- wtf happened in my college class on this?


### Control Theory
- PID tuning
- wtf happened in my college class on this?


### Signal Processing
- Kalman filter
	- [kalmanjs](https://github.com/wouterbulten/kalmanjs)
	- [Kalman.js](https://github.com/infusion/Kalman.js/)
- sensor fusion
	- [wtf is sensor fusion](https://towardsdatascience.com/wtf-is-sensor-fusion-part-2-the-good-old-kalman-filter-3642f321440)


### Image Processing | Manipulation | Creation
- object detection
- background removal
- chop and remix and shuffle an image
- basic operations I want to do all the time
	- crop
	- paste and add text or speech bubble
	- graph of nodes with connections
	- slideshows
	- scan multiple pages into a pdf document
- procedural art


### Game Helpers
- Line Rangers
	- whats the best ranger to upgrade?
	- how often do certain rewards drop?
	- is it worth it to purchase something?
	- what is the best gear to place on ranger?


### Math (see mathematics.js)
- convolution - [intuitive convolution](https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-convolution/)
- z-transform
- eigenvalues
- fourier transform


### Bookmarks | Read Later | Wish List | Todo
- all of this in one place
- can be searched easily
- can be globbed together
- can be shared
- will remind me to come back to it
