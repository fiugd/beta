SUPER IMPORTANT:
- need git...

PRETTY IMPORTANT:
- ls needs to display contents better
- history has issues with wrapped lines
- cat doesn't work
- not sure if mv works
- current working dir should rely on state of terminal, not app state ?
- system name should come at terminal boot (from app)
- not sure if rm works

INSANE WITH VARYING LEVELS OF MASOCHISM:
- help includes args notes for commands listed
- watch runs javascript files kinda like nodemon/node does
- indication of file versus folder in ls
- file/folder icons in ls
